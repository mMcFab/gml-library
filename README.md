# gml-library
 Gerneral GML Library File

This project is a collection of general GML scripts and utilities I often use. The GameMaker project is an unsorted collection of the source. 

I use these in pretty much all of my main 3D projects now, including Too Many Birds!â„¢, UFOria, and Potatowned (if that ever finally gets released lol)

Some included things are:

- Some basic Vec structs (Vec2, Vec3, and Vec4)
- A more programmer-friendly 3D camera class - less setup and hopefully better performance
- Basic structs that aid with very basic 3D raycasting (Ray3D, Plane3D - Triangle3D will come later for basic geometry collision support)
- A template HLSL shader
- Matrix transpose, inverse, and matrix_transform_vertex4 (allows passing and returning a w component)
- Functions to transform coordinates between world space and screen space. 

I'm releasing this under the MIT license, so you can use this stuff for whatever you need to, for free. Credit is not required, but greatly appreciated 

I'll clean up, document and package some things later, but it became higher priority recently to at least put this stuff somewhere easily accessible for now (it was available on my website in some chunks, but that's harder to find)
I basically add stuff to this as I need it, so it will expand as I use it more
